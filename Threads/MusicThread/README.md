##### Purpose
Demonstrate the use of a thread to provide interruptable background
playing of a wav file.
To make this example work, there must be a wav file in the project directory whose name matches the user-selected node in the JTree.
Select the tree node (example ComeMonday) then select the `Music-->Play` menu item to play the file:` ComeMonday.wav` in the project directory. 
Notice you can select a new node and then play to move to a new song. Or, select Play again to restart from the beginning
of the current song.
You can generate a wav file for your an mp3 using the web site:
